Android based DBMS project uses SQLite as database.

This app serves students and faculties to perform day-to-day activities on a registered course.

Students can : Register a course(or courses), Start student discussion for that particular course, access course material links uploaded by respective course faculty and
get announcement for that course.

Faculties can : Register a course, make course announcement, upload course material links, send test notifications for students registered to that course, access student
discussion.

Note : App is primarily created for demonstration of Database operations. Since Database used is sqlite, so each user has to use same app to access their functionalities. But Sqlite database can be easily replaced with other server based database for remote access.

Minimum Android version required : Android 5.0
